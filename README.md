I am still having the same issues with this repository as I messed it up so horribly in CA1.
But nonetheless, got my JPA and hibernate setup using a test class to verify DB Pasring.
My commits are a mess due to the amount of files being committed. But if you use the search filter bar and search GreenhouseGases. The files for this CA Can be found there!
