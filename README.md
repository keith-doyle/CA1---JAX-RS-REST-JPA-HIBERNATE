Hopefully this will be end of the struggles for this repo :)
It's a complete mess I all my branches are destroyed with the mistakes I made while committing CA1
I've decided to make a brand new local repo on my system and also a brand new branch just for CA2
Hopefully now I will be able to commit this straight to the new branch
Also as I have a brand new local repo communityFitnessCenter (CA1) Should not be causing anymore issues
As the previous local repo I was using had multiple projects within it including CA1 and many others. 
Sorry for all the hassle with this but it should be fixed going forward now, apologies.
